# Custom Tiptap Extension for React

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Custom Tiptap Extension** in a React.js application. Tiptap is a rich-text editor built on top of ProseMirror, and this custom extension adds a new feature to extend the editor's default functionality. 

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a creative and unique Tiptap extension, different from any pre-existing ones provided by Tiptap, such as emoji or highlighter extensions.

## Features of the Custom Extension

- **[Custom Feature]:** [Provide a brief description of what your custom extension does and how it enhances the editor experience. Make sure the extension you build is unique from the pre-built ones in Tiptap].
  
  Example:
  - Custom **Annotation** feature that allows users to add interactive, non-obtrusive annotations to any text segment.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Seamlessly integrates with the existing editor interface.
  
- **Highly Configurable:** Easily customizable with various options (e.g., customizable annotation colors, notes, etc.).
